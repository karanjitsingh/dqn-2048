# dqn-2048-python | Q-learning implementation

A reinforcement learning bot written in python that learns to play 2048 from the experience gained from playing it again and again. This project was done for my 6th semester Machine Learning course at Manipal Institute of Technology. Along with the implementation of the game 2048,
the project implements neural networks, q-learning and TD-backpropagation algorithm from scratch.
